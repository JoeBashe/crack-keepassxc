Brute force keepassxc cracker

## Description

Brute force password cracker for any version of KeePass database file supported by [pykeepass](https://github.com/libkeepass/pykeepass). 
Starts with any base passwords you add in `guesses.txt` file, and appends strings generated by `itertools.product` and the `CHARS` constant,
up to `MAX_LENGTH`. `POOL_SIZE` constant controls number of processes in the process pool and is set to 3 by default. 

## Usage

1. Create `guesses.txt` with one password guess per line.
2. Run
   ```shell
   python bruteforce.py my_password_file.kdbx
   ```
3. Profit! (program will let you know if/when the password is found)

## Installation (\*nix)

```shell
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## TODO

- Allow MAX_LENGTH and POOL_SIZE to be overridden via CLI options.
